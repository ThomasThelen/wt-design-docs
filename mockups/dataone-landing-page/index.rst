DataONE to WholeTale Landing Page
=================================

Mockup of what users coming from DataONE will see when they attempt to launch a tale using a DataONE package.

Behavior:

 1. When the dialog opens, data registration automatically begins.
 2. If the frontend cards are hovered (anticipating a user clicking "launch")
     while data is still being registered, a tooltip is displayed letting them
     know that they need to wait until all data is  registered.
 3. Each file has it's own status bar which is updated as the registration
     process advances.
 4. The file system will match that of what the user experiences inside the
     Tale, which is not reflected in the mockup.
