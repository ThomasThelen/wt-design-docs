DataONE to WholeTale Landing Page
=================================

Mockup of what users coming from DataONE will see when they attempt to launch a tale using a DataONE package.

Behavior:

#. When the dialog opens, data registration automatically begins.
#. If the frontend cards are hovered (anticipating a user clicking "launch")
   while data is still being registered, a tooltip is displayed letting them
   know that they need to wait until all data is  registered.
#. Each file has it's own status bar which is updated as the registration
   process advances.
#. The file system will match that of what the user experiences inside the
   Tale, which is not reflected in the mockup.
