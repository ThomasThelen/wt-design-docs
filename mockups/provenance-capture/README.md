Provenance Capture
==================

How will the WT user, in combination with the WT Dashboard, capture Tale Provenance?

Possible sources of provenance
------------------------------

 - The WT manifest itself is sort of a prospective provenance trace
 - The running container could be inspected capture some minimal provenance (like files written out to disk)
 - We could encourage/assist/mandate the user use some of the provenance tools already available in Jupyter
 - The user could manually write out provenance information in their frontend
