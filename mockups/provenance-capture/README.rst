Provenance Capture
==================

How will the WT user, in combination with the WT Dashboard, capture Tale Provenance?

Possible sources of provenance
------------------------------

 - The WT manifest itself is sort of a prospective provenance trace
 - The running container could be inspected capture some minimal provenance (like files written out to disk)
 - We could encourage/assist/mandate the user use some of the provenance tools already available in Jupyter
 - The user could manually write out provenance information in their frontend


More notes (TODO: integrate)

- Provenance capture in the front end
    - Automatic
    - Manual
    - Could use recordr in RStudio and capture that PROV
    - TODO: Check out https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow
    - Lots of intrest in notebook environments, and capturing prov in Jupyter
      - Esp w/ YesWorkflow
    - See NoWorkflow too
    - See tickets from prov-a-thon
